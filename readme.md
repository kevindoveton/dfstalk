# DFSTalk
## DFSTalk is an Open Source Library and Service for converting numbers and dates into multi-lingual audio


## Motivation

This service was born out of a need to convert numbers "eg. 120,329" into intelligible audio in Swahili for IVR messages to rural Tanzanians. When we talked to some developers from Jumo, we realised that this was a shared need, and thought this would be a great partnership opportunity. 


We figured that this libary could be very useful for others working in financial inclusion both in Africa and around the world, and thus decided to release it publicly under an Open Source license. The hope for this project is that others can add their own languages (no matter how specific) and benefit financial inclusion projects around the world.
